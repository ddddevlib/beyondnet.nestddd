/** 
Saga is a long-running process that listens to events and may trigger new commands. It is usually used to manage complex workflows in the application. For example, when a user signs up, a saga may listen to the UserRegisteredEvent and send a welcome email to the user.
Sagas are an extremely powerful feature. A single saga may listen for 1..* events. Using the RxJS library, we can filter, map, fork, and merge event streams to create sophisticated workflows. Each saga returns an Observable which produces a command instance. This command is then dispatched asynchronously by the CommandBus.
